<h1>Santander Customer Satisfaction - Kaggle Competition</h1>
<h2> Problem Overview </h2>
From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.

Santander Bank is asking Kagglers to help them identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Doing so would allow Santander to take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it's too late.

In this problem, the task is to work with hundreds of anonymized features provided in the dataser to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.

<h2> Avaibale Data </h2>

<h2> Task </h2>
